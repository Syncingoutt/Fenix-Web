<h1>Fenix - FE per hour tracker</h1>

<p>Torchlight Infinite overlay tracking app for real-time FE per hour and inventory updates.</p>

<p>This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by XD (XD inc.) in any way.</p>

<p><b>Something to note, since I do not use the Chinese FE tracker DB, a lot of items might be missing. There are 135 items in the JSON file, so you will definitely see some items that are (unkown item(ID), however, i constantly update it as I play)</b></p>

<i>Disclaimer: Portions of this repository were created or refined using AI-assisted development tools. Cursor and Claude AI were both used extensively for script writing. UI/UX design was made by me without the use of AI.</i>

  </summary>
<h2>Tracking modes</h2>
<h3>Total</h3>
See the amount of FE you have earned. There is a button to reset it, but it always tracks your inventory, unlike the "Hourly" mode.<br><br>
<img width="800" height="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/820b3ed2-256d-4696-8b20-12424d6ffcb3" />
<br><br>
<h3>Hourly</h3>
<p>Clears the items that are already in your inventory and instead shows only new drops</p><br><br>

<h4>Hourly sessions</h4>
  <p>If you use the Hourly mode for multiple hours, you will be able to see each hour individually</p>

<br><br>
<h2>Inventory</h2>
<p>See all the items that you have obtained or have already obtained based on the mode you have selected</p><br><br>

<br><br>
<h3>Automatic price updating</h3>
<p>When you price check an item, it will automatically reflect in the app.</p>
<p><i>Note: I do have plans to make a database so that when any user price checks the item, if it's a recent price check, it sends that data syncing up with other users, but currently this works locally.</i></p>
<h3>Breakdown</h3>
<p>Here you can see a breakdown of all the items you have collected and the price of that group</p>

  <summary><h2>How does it work?</h2></summary>
  <p>The program works by extracting data from a log file within the game files called UE_game.log, located in</p>
  <code>SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Torchlight Infinite\UE_game\TorchLight\Saved\Logs.</code><br><br>
  <p>By enabling logging, we can extract updates that happen within the inventory, including price checking, sorting -> returning full inventory, or inventory updates by picking up loot.</p>
  <p>No memory reading or injection is used — all data is extracted from existing log output generated by the game.</p>
  <p>The program was written in TypeScript using Electron for UI, updates, etc...</p>

      <b>Strategies</b> the ability to create a strategy, select what compasses are used, tree, etc.. and show FE/hr of that strategy with item breakdown.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Database</b> for item price checking syncing between users, making tracking prices even easier.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Tax</b> Currently, tax is not applied to items; the plan is to add a toggle in the settings drop-down to enable tax.

<summary><h2>Why is SmartScreen detecting this app?</h2></summary>
<p>Windows SmartScreen may show a warning when you first download Fenix because the installer is not code-signed. This is normal for open-source software distributed without a code signing certificate.</p>

<h3>Is it safe?</h3>
<p><strong>Yes, it's safe.</strong> The app is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open source - you can review the code on GitHub</li>
  <li>Hosted on GitHub Releases (a trusted source)</li>
  <li>Not signed with a certificate (which costs $100-400/year)</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to install despite the warning:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>When you see the SmartScreen warning, click <strong>"More info"</strong></li>
  <li>Click <strong>"Run anyway"</strong> (this option appears after clicking "More info")</li>
  <li>Proceed with the installation</li>
</ol>

<p><i>Note: After enough users download and run the installer from GitHub, Windows may build reputation for the file and the warning may disappear automatically over time. This typically takes several months with regular downloads.</i></p>
