<h1>Fenix</h1>

<p>Torchlight Infinite overlay tracking app for real-time FE per hour and inventory updates.</p>

<p>This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by XD (XD inc.) in any way.</p>

<p>Something to note, since I do not use the Chinese FE tracker DB, a lot of items might be missing. There are 135 items in the JSON file, so you will definitely see some items that are (unkown item(ID), however, i constantly update it as I play)</p>

<i>Disclaimer: Portions of this repository were created or refined using AI-assisted development tools. Cursor and Claude AI were both used extensively for script writing. UI/UX design was made by me without the use of AI.</i>

<h2>Setting it up</h2>

<h2>Tracking modes</h2>
<h3>Total</h3>
See the amount of FE you have earned. There is a button to reset it, but it always tracks your inventory, unlike the "Hourly" mode.<br><br>

<br><br>
<h3>Hourly</h3>
<p>Clears the items that are already in your inventory and instead shows only new drops</p><br><br>

<br><br>
<h2>Inventory</h2>
<p>See all the items that you have obtained or have already obtained based on the mode you have selected</p><br><br>

<br><br>
<h3>Automatic price updating</h3>
<p>When you price check an item, it will automatically reflect in the app.</p>
<p><i>Note: I do have plans to make a database so that when any user price checks the item, if it's a recent price check, it sends that data syncing up with other users, but currently this works locally.</i></p>

  <summary><h2>How does it work?</h2></summary>
  <p>The program works by extracting data from a log file within the game files called UE_game.log, located in</p>
  <code>SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Torchlight Infinite\UE_game\TorchLight\Saved\Logs.</code><br><br>
  <p>By enabling logging, we can extract updates that happen within the inventory, including price checking, sorting -> returning full inventory, or inventory updates by picking up loot.</p>
  <p>No memory reading or injection is used — all data is extracted from existing log output generated by the game.</p>
  <p>The program was written in TypeScript using Electron for UI, updates, etc...</p>
